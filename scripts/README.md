# Reporting Deployment

Reporting can now be installed directly as part of the respective OpenG2P Module. For example, refer to [Social Registry deployment](https://docs.openg2p.org/social-registry/deployment) or [PBMS deployment](https://docs.openg2p.org/pbms/deployment).

This directory contains module-wise debezium connectors, opensearch connectors, opensearch dashboards, etc.

Source code for OpenG2P [Reporting](../charts/reporting) helm chart.
This installs Reporting along with all the required dependencies.

## Standalone Installation

This section describes steps to install Reporting on your K8s cluster, if not installing as part of OpenG2P Modules.
